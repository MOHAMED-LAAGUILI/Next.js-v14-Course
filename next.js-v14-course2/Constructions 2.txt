we define a lyout for the register parent that has 2 whildren a and b 
the layout of register parent inherit Layout from the main layout in the src/app folder
thats mean register is a child if app in result a and b folders will use there parent layout wich is register
lets say we have another folder c and we dont want to apply layyout to it but it in the same dir and takes layout
we add a group layout using ()
 (with-layout) create that folder with any name surrounded with () and mov the layout to it and the folders/routes that u wanna use that layout
